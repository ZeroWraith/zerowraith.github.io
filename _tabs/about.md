Hi, **I'm Aaditya Pratap Singh**, a Computer Vision and AI developer passionate about building practical, high-performance applications that solve real-world problems.

This blog is my digital workshop. It's where I document my process of learning, building, and sharingâ€”transforming complex theory into tangible results. You'll find detailed, step-by-step tutorials, deep dives into core CV/AI concepts, and the lessons I learn from my hands-on projects.

## My "Learn, Build, Share" Philosophy

I believe the best way to master a skill is to build with it and then teach it. Every project and article on this site is part of that public journey.

- **Learn**: I focus on the "why" behind the code, not just the "how."

- **Build**: I apply these concepts to practical projects, from simple image processors to complex deep-learning models.

- **Share**: I document the entire process here to help others learn and to demonstrate my expertise.

**Why @zerowraith?**

While I operate professionally as Aaditya Pratap Singh, you'll find all of my source code and projects on GitHub under my long-standing developer handle, **@zerowraith**.

This blog is the bridge: **@zerowraith** is the workshop where the code is built, and Aaditya Pratap Singh is the professional who explains how it works and delivers the solution.

Let's Connect

I am currently available for freelance projects and new opportunities. If you have a challenging problem in computer vision, I can help you build the solution.
